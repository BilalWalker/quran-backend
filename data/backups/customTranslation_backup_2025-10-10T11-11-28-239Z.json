      "When they meet (true) Believers, they say, “We too are Believers.” And when private with their devils, they say, “With you people, we are.",
      "Only jokes, we were cracking.” Allah returns back their joking. Them, in their contumacy, lets He loose, blindly wandering.",
      "They are purchasers of error, at the price of (true) guidance. So their trading did not prosper, and they were not on (good) guidance.",

      "Then after your becoming lifeless, We resurrected… you, so that you might become thankful, (appreciative).",
      "Of clouds, We gave you shade; sent on you Manna and Quails. “Eat of those good things which as sustenance to you, We gave.” It was not Us that they wronged, but themselves, they did wrong.",

      "and give more to right-doers. Then altered the wrongdoers, word ordained to another. So for their disobedience, from sky, We sent down punishment on wrongdoers.",
      "And We said, when water for his people, Musa asked for, “Strike rock with your staff:” gushed from it twelve springs. Each group knew whence to drink. “Of such good things eat and drink, which Allah gave; and in land spread no mischief, evil thing.”",
      "When you said, “O’ Musa! We cannot (put up/bear) with this one food; what grows earth, call on your Lord, for us, to produce— of its herbs and cucumbers, and (garlic,/wheat and) lentils and onions.\" Musa said, “Would you exchange the better one for the (lesser/meaner). (Well), get down in Egypt /some town). You will get what you require.\" And were (stamped/pitched) upon them, dishonor and destitution. And they incurred Allah’s wrath; (drew on them, His indignation). This, for they denied Allah’s (Signs/Verses); and they slew His Prophets, wrongfully; this, for their disobedience and transgression.",
      "Surely those, in Our this Holy Prophet who believed, and they who were Jews and Christians and Sabeans, whoso believed… with true heart, in Allah and Last Day, and did good deeds: they will have their reward, with (Allah,) their true Lord. No fear will be on them, nor will they ever grieve.",
      "When We took covenant from you, raising (Mount/Tur) above you, (saying), “Hold fast to what We have vouchsafed you; what is therein, remember; that you may have Allah’s fear.”",
      "Then you (O’ Children of Israel), turned away thereafter. And but for Allah’s grace and mercy on you, lost, you were.",
      "And you know well those of you, Sabbath, who did violate; (caught fish on Saturday). We said, “Be despised apes.”",
      "This punishment, We made, a warning to their own generation, and to succeeding generations; and to righteous men, a lesson.",
      "When Musa said to his people, “Allah bids you surely… to slaughter a cow.” They said, “Do you take us in mockery?” He said, “Allah forbid that so (ignorant/simpleton/unwise) I be (and lowly!)”",
      "They said, “Call on your Lord to tell us, what cow it is!” Said he, “Says He, not so old, nor too young, this cow is: it is of age in between. So do what you are commanded.”",
      "They said, “Call on your Lord to tell us, of what colour, it is!” He said, “Allah says, a yellow cow, bright in colour, it is; giving great pleasure (and enjoyment) to beholders, it is.\"",
      "They said, “Call on your Lord to make clear to us, what it is! To us, cows are much alike. God willing, we will be guided.”",
      "Said, “He says, a cow unyoked; the soil, it does not plough, nor does it water fields; sound it is, blemish-free.\" They said, “Truth, you brought now, (right description of cow.)\" They sacrificed it though with no mind to do so.",

      "Said We, “Strike it with its piece. Thus the dead, Allah enlivens. And He shows you His Signs, that you may apply reason.”",
      "Then your hearts became hard after it; they are as rocks, or even harder, for rivers burst forth from some rocks; and when split asunder, water (issues/comes) forth from some (rocks); and for (awe/fear) of Allah, (their Lord), fall down some (rocks). Allah is not unaware of you are doing, whatever.",
      "That the Jews should believe you, do you (Muslims) covet? Of them, some would hear Allah’s Word, then would pervert it, after they understood it; knowingly, they would do it.",
      "When they meet (true) Believers, they say, “We, believed, too.” When alone with each other, they say, “Do you tell (O’ Jews), to Muslims, what Allah opened to you, that they may dispute… with you before your Lord; reason, then, do you not use?\"",
      "Know they not that Allah knows, all they hide and disclose?",
      "Some of them are illiterate, nothing of the Book, who know, but their own (false notions/oral reading), and they merely suppose.",
      "Woe to those who write the Book with their hands, then they say, “This is from Allah,” to gain small price in exchange. Woe to them for what their hands write and what earn, they.",
      "And they said, “The Fire will not touch us but for counted days.” Say, “From Allah did you take vow, which Allah will not break. Or what is not in your knowledge, concerning Allah, you say?”",
      "Yes, why not, he who does evil, and his sin encircles him, such are people of Hell; they will abide in it forever.",
      "And they who (truly) believed, and (in life) did good deeds, are people of Paradise; they will live in it forever.",
      "(Remember), when from Children of Israel, We took covenant: “Worship none except Allah. And be good to your parents, kindred, orphans and the needy; and to people, speak nicely; set up Salat and pay Zakat, (say Prayers, give alms-due).” Save a few, then you withdrew. You are averse to the truth.",
      "When We took covenant from you, “No blood, among yourselves, shed. Expel not from homes each other.” Then you pledged, and you witnessed.",
      "Then it is you, slaying (your own/each other); evicting some, from their homes; helping (their foes), in sin and (injustice/aggression) against them. And if they should come to you as captives, you would ransom them, whereas unlawful for you itself was to banish them. Do you then believe in some parts of the Book and deny others. So what will be his reward, among you does this, whoever, but in (worldly/this) life, dishonor; and towards the most severe… punishment, they shall be driven, on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is, of whatever you do, never unaware.",
      "These are they who bought life of this world, for Hereafter. Their punishment shall not be lightened, nor shall they be succoured.",
      "To Musa We gave the Book, and after him sent in succession, other Messengers, and gave (Signs/Proofs) to Isa, son of Maryam, very clear; and him, with the Holy Spirit, We did strengthen. Is it that whenever there came to you any Messeger, (from your true Lord, Allah,) with which you did not desire, you grew arrogant; some you denied, and slew some others?",
      "They said, “Our hearts are covered. Nay, for their Disbelief, Allah cursed them; so (little it is that they/ only a few of them) believe.",
      "And from Allah, when this Book came to them, confirming theirs, and they prayed before this for victory over Disbelievers, (through this Prophet with this Book); when he, whom they recognized, came to them, him, they denied. Allah’s curse on Disbelievers!",
      "For which they have sold their lives; evil, (vile), is that (pride/price), that what Allah sent down, they deny it out of spite: that with grace Allah reveals, to anyone He does please, from among His devotees. Wrath on wrath, they did incur. And there is humiliating punishment for Disbelievers.",
      "And when they are asked, “Believe in what Allah has revealed!” They say, “In that we believe, which to us has been revealed.” And in rest, they disbelieve, (which is after it revealed,) though truth it is, confirming what is with them, already. Say, “Why did you slay Allah’s Prophets before, if you believed?”",
      "And surely Musa came to you with Signs, vivid, clear. Then you made the calf, a god, in his absence; unjust, you were.",
      "When We took covenant from you; (Mount/Tur) above you, we did raise. “What We give you, hold it fast. And listen to what We say!” They said (insolently), “We did hear, and we disobey.” And the calf, sank into their hearts, for their Disbelief. Say, “Vile is command of your Belief, if you have some Belief!”",
      "Say you, “If the Last Home, with Allah, is not for others, and for you alone, (aspire/long) then for death, if truthful you are!”",
      "And they will never aspire for it, because of their deeds, what their hands sent (ahead/before); Allah knows wrongdoers.",
      "You will surely find them greediest of men for life, even more than Idolaters. Each one of them would like, a thousand years of life. And him, this prolonged life, will not save from punishment. Allah sees your all actions.",
      "Say you (O’ Beloved), “Whoever is foe to Jibrael: he it is, who brought down this (Qur’an) by Allah’s leave, to your heart, which confirms Books, before it (revealed). Guidance it is; and good news to them who (truly) believe.",
      "To Allah, His Angels, Messengers, Jibreel and Mekaeel, whoso is foe, then Allah is foe to those who disbelieve.”",
      "(O’ Beloved)! Clear Messages to you, We have revealed. In them no one but only the disobedient, disbelieve.",
      "Is it (not), that whenever they made a promise, some of them, threw it aside. Nay, faithless (indeed) are most of them.",
      "And (now) when a Messenger from Allah has come to them, confirming what is with them, some men of the Scripture cast, behind their backs, Allah’s Scripture, as if they knew not.",
      "They follow what devils read out in reign of Sulaiman. And it was devils who disbelieved, and not Sulaiman. Devils taught people, magic; and what was descended on… two angels, Harut and Marut, in (city) Babylon. They did not teach anyone till they said, “We are but for trial. So be not a Disbeliever, (do not lose your Iman).” From them people learned to separate man and his wife, a charm. And, but by Allah’s command, no one by it they can harm. And they learn which harms them; no profit which earns them. They know that in Hereafter, its purchaser has no share. Evil is, for which they sell themselves, if they only knew.",
      "If they had accepted faith, keeping from evil away, then reward from Allah would be better, if they only knew.",
      "O’ Believers! Say not “ra’ina,” (but something unambiguous.) Say (to Our Beloved,) “unzurna,” (look with mercy on us.) Be attentive listeners! For Disbelievers is torment, grievous.",
      "The Infidels, whether people of the Book, or Idolaters, do not love that good be sent to you from your Lord (ever.) And Allah selects, whom He wills, for His special mercy. Allah is Lord of abounding grace, (too great is His bounty.)",
      "Any Verse We abrogate, or cause it to be forgotten, We bring better one (in place); or to it, a similar one. Know you not, Allah can do everything, (He is Omnipotent)?",
      "Know you not that kingdom of heavens and earth belongs to Allah? And none is your patron, or your helper, apart from Allah.",
      "Would you ask your (this) Prophet, as Musa was, before, asked? He who changes Faith for Disbelief, strayed from Right Path.",
      "Many people of the Scripture wish to make you Disbelievers, after your believing, out of selfish envy of theirs, when to them, the truth is clear; so forgive (them) and forbear, till, brings, Allah, His will; over everything, Allah has power.",
      "Set up Salat and pay Zakat. You will find with Allah, good you… sent ahead for yourselves. Yes, Allah sees all you do.",
      "They said, “None but Jew or Christian can enter Paradise.” These are their wishes, (desires). Say, “(Bring/Show) proof, if right, you are!”",
      "Yes, to Allah whoever submits his face, and virtuous he is: his reward is with his Lord; for them no fear, no grief.",
      "Jews said, “Christians have no base.” Christians said, “Jews have no base.” And the Book, recite, they. The ignorant men, too, say… similar to what they say. On the Resurrection Day, Allah will judge between them in what did dispute, they.",
      "Who is more unjust than he who prevents from mosques of Allah; that His name be mentioned there, and to ruin them, endeavours. For such ones, it was not proper to enter them, but in fear. For them, disgrace in this world and great torment in Hereafter.",
      "East and West, all is for Allah. There is (countenance/the presence) of Allah, wherever you turn. All Embracing, All Knowing, is, Allah.",

      "The Originator of heavens and earth, (all things). And He says to it, “Be,” and it is, when He decrees a thing.",
      "Those without knowledge say, “Why does not Allah speak to us, or some Sign come to us?” Men before them said the like… of their saying, likewise. Their hearts are all alike. For people of firm Faith, We have made Our signs clear.",
      "We have sent you (with/in) truth as Bearer of good news, and Warner. You will not be questioned about people of Hell (O’ Dear).",
      "With you, Jews will not be pleased, nor Christians, till their creed… you follow. Say, “Only guidance of Allah is real guidance.” And after receiving knowledge, if you will follow their desires: you, from Allah have no Protector (O’ Listener,) nor a helper.",
      "Those to whom the Book We gave, (who) recite it as it should be: they believe in it; they who deny it, losers, they would be.",

      "When assembling place and peace for men, this House, We made; and said, “Take Ibrahim’s station, for prayer, a place!” We bade Ibrahim and Ismail, “Cleanse My House, for them who go round it, and for worship, in it who stay, and who bow down, and then put brow on ground, (when they pray)!",
      "When said Ibrahim, “O’ Lord! Make it land of peace (and truce). Feed its men believing in Allah and Last Day with fruits. He said, “I shall let enjoy a (little/while), an Infidel too: force to doom of Fire then, him: an evil journey’s end.”",

(To My Will, submit),” he said, “To the Lord of all worlds, I do submit.” O02.132 Ibrahim did bequeath to his (sons/seed), the same (creed/religion); so did Yaqoob: O’ my children! Allah chose this religion… for you; so die not except as Muslims, (on this true religion).",
      "Were you present, when death came to Yaqoob. His sons, he asked, “After me what will you worship?” Said, “We shall worship your God: God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Ismail and Ishaq: One (true) God, to Him we submit, (of all worlds, Lord).”",
      "They were a people, (through nature, to Eternity) who passed. For them is what they have earned. And for you, what you have earned. And you people will, of what they used to do, not be asked.",

      "Do you say that Ibrahim, Ismail, Ishaq and yaqoob, and their sons were Jews or Christians? Say, “Knows Allah best, or you?” Who is more unjust than one hiding evidence from Allah, which he has; Allah is not heedless of what you do.",
      "That was a people of past; for them is what they have earned. And for you is (consequence of) whatever you have earned. And you will never be questioned about what they have (done/earned).",

      "Thus We made you (Best/Just) Ummah, so that you may bear witness… to men, and this Noble Messenger, be over you, a witness. And We made the Qiblah, on which you had been, only to see, who follows (Our) Messenger, and who turns upon his heels. And hard it was but for those, who had been guided by Allah. And to waste your Faith, it was not purpose of Allah. Verily Allah is Kind, very Kind to mankind.",
      "Frequently turning your face towards (heavens/sky), We see you. Now towards a Qiblah, dear to you, We will turn you. Turn then your face to Sacred Mosque, (Ka’aba, O’ Beloved)! And wherever you men be, turn your faces towards it. Holders of the Book know that it is the truth from their Lord. And of whatever they do, Allah is, unaware, not.",

      "Those who (devour usury/swallow interest), they will not rise except… as one whom Satan demented by his (evil) contact.

So he who refrained, receiving direction from his Lord, (his is/for him), what he took in past. With Allah is his affair. And he who reverts to it again, such are men of Fire. They (will never come out of it), will live in it for ever.",

So he should write, and he who incurs debt, should dictate, and he should fear Allah, his Lord, and (leave out/diminish) nothing. If debtor is unwise, weak, or unable to dictate, let his guardian fairly (and impartially) dictate. And out of your own men, get two witnesses; If two men are not available there (as witnesses), then a man, and two women, you approve as witnesses; that if one of the two errs, other woman reminds her. These witnesses, when they are called, must decline not. To write it, small or big, till time fixed, disdain not. Before Allah, it is closer to justice, in proof (better/stronger); and nearest it is to saving you from doubts (in future). But if it is usual hand to hand trading among you, then if you write it not, there is no blame on you. Make witnesses when trading. To scribe and one witnessing… let no harm be done; if you do, it is a sin in you. Fear Allah; teaches you, Allah. Everything is known to Allah.",
      "If on journey, you find no scribe, then pledge with possession. If one another you trust, let trustee fulfil his trust, and fear his Lord, Allah. And hide not evidence. He who hides evidence, surely sinful is his heart. And Allah has (comprehensive) knowledge of your all actions.",

And a heavy burden (with your kindness), on us, lay not, as you laid on those people, who were before us O’ Lord. And put not a burden on us, we cannot bear O’ Lord.

And so did Rabbies and Priests; for it was required from them… to preserve the Book of Allah, and they are witnesses to it. Fear not men, fear Me; and accept not a mean price… for My Revelations. He who judges not according to it, from Allah which is revealed, they are Infidels indeed.",

You will all return to Allah, then He will inform you about what you disagreed.",

And to you from your Lord (O’ Beloved) what is revealed, will increase wickedness of many of them, and Disbelief. We put enmity and hatred among them till Day of Judgment. Allah puts it out, they kindle fire of war, whenever. To corrupt the land, they strive; Allah loves not corrupters.",

      "Al Maseeh son of Maryam was but a (holy) Messenger. (Similarly) passed away before him, many Messengers! Truthful woman was, his mother. Food both used to eat. See (O’ Beloved) how We explain (to/for) them clearly… Our (Verses/Signs); then how they are turned away, you just see!",

      "The Disbelievers were cursed among Israel’s Children, by the tongue of Prophet Dawood, and of Isa, son of Maryam. This was due to their disobedience and their transgression.",
      "They restrained not each other from evil-doings they did: (supporting, promoting evil): vile indeed is what they did.",
      "You see many of them making friends with (other) Disbelievers. Evil thing, they sent ahead of them, for them; that Allah’s wrath… fell on them; and in the torment, they will abide forever.",

      "When they hear what is sent to Messenger, you see their eyes… (overflow/brim over) with tears, because of truth they did recognize. They say, “Lord! We believe; as witnesses inscribe us.",
      "Why should We not believe in Allah, and truth which came to us? We hope our Lord will admit us among the righteous.”",
      "For their words Allah (rewarded/awarded) them Gardens, to dwell forever, with rivers flowing beneath; that is reward of the righteous.",

      "Allah does not punish you for what is (futile/vain) in your oaths. But He takes you to task for what you swear (solemnly/in earnest). Then the expiation of a broken oath is the feeding… of ten needy men with average food you give your family, or the clothing of them or liberation of a neck, (a slave). He who does not find anything should fast for three days. This will be the expiation of your oaths, when you swear. And abide by your oaths. Thus does Allah make clear… His Revelations to you, so that thanks you may render.",

      "With some such game animals, Allah will test you O’ Believers! which your hands may catch, and which may be reached by your spears, that Allah may make known him, (unseen/in secret), Him, who fears. Grievous torment is for him who transgresses thereafter.",

Whoso of you kills it knowingly, will recompense it… with an equivalent of the livestock which he killed, as is judged by two just persons among you, an offering reaching Ka’bah; or feeding some men indigent, as an expiation; or of that in fasting, equivalent; so that he may taste grave consequences of his deed. Allah has forgiven what is past, but he who repeats, Allah will avenge Himself on him (for his disobedience). And Allah is Dominant; He is Lord of Retribution.",
      "Lawful to you is pursuit and (the food /eating) of water-game: a provision for you and for travellers, but land-game… is forbidden so long as you are in Pilgrim attire. And fear Allah towards whom you will all be gathered.",
      "Allah has appointed the (Holy) Ka’bah, the Sacred House, a means of support and security for mankind; and the sacred month; and the offerings to the Sacred House; and the collared animals. That is, so that you may know… that what is in heavens and what is in earth, Allah knows;",

      "Take care, Believers, of your own souls; he who erred… cannot harm you when you are guided; you will all return… to Allah; He will inform you whatever you have done.",
      "Believers! When death approaches one of you, making a will, the evidence is of two honest men from among you; or two others not of you; when calamity of death, while you are travelling in the land, overtakes you. You detain them after prayers; by Allah then they should swear, if in any doubt, you are: “We shall not sell it for price, even to a kinsman; nor at all we shall hide, Allah’s testimony, for then we shall surely be sinners.”",
      "Then if it is known that they have been guilty of a sin, let two other nearer ones, injured by the sin of earlier… two, stand in their place. Now by Allah, they should swear: “Our evidence is more upright than their evidence. We exceeded not limit, for then we should be wrongdoers.”",
      "It is nearer that in its true shape, witness, they may bear, [or fear that other oaths would be taken after theirs/ or fear that their oaths could be refuted by (others’/heirs’).] Fear Allah and hear; Allah guides not the (evil-doers/lawbreakers).",

      "They will bring to your presence each knowing, (skilled) magician.”",
      "The magicians came to Fir’aun and said, “Surely there… will be a reward for us, if we are defeaters, (victors)(./?)",

      "They said, “Musa! You throw first, or (we shall/let us) be throwers first.”",
      "He said, “Throw!” So when they threw, people’s eyes, they enchanted. And they terrified them, and produced a mighty magic.",
      "We inspired Musa, “Throw down your staff,” and it swallowed… up at once their lying shows; (all, there, what they had forged).",
      "Thus the truth prevailed; and what they were doing, proved vain.",
      "There they were defeated; turned humiliated, (put to shame).",
      "Wizards fell down in prostration; they said, “We believe…",

      "Said chiefs of Fir’aun’s people, “Will you let Musa and his men… spread mischief in the land, and allow them to abandon… you and your gods?” He said, “Now we shall slay their sons, and shall let live their daughters; over them, we are in power.”",
      "Musa said to his people, “Seek Allah’s Help and endure. Surely Allah’s is the earth. He does make its inheritors, whom He wills of His slaves. For pious men is the future.”",

      "We, with years (of famine), and with dearth of fruits seized, people of (cruel) Fir’aun, that they might take heed.",

      "And they said, “Whatever Sign to bewitch us, you may bring, we shall not believe in you, (it is a decided thing).”",
      "Then We sent on them the flood, locusts, (lice/vermin), frogs and blood— distinct Signs, they grew then proud, and they were sinful men.",
      "And when the punishment fell on them, they said, “O’ Musa! Pray… for us to your Lord because of covenant He has with you. If you lift the suffering from us, we will then believe in you, and will send Children of Israel surely with you.”",

      "So We took vengeance on them, and in sea We drowned them, for they denied Our Signs, and no heed they gave to them.",
      "And We made a suppressed people, heirs of the eastern and the… western parts of that land, in which We put Our blessings. And your Lord’s fair promise to children of Israel, was fulfilled for their patience. And We destroyed everything… Fir’aun and his people made, and the structures that they raised.",
      "And across the sea, the Children of Israel, We brought. They came on a people sitting devoted to their idols. They said, “Make for us a god O’ Musa, just as they have gods.” He said, “You are men ignorant. (You forgot your true God)!",

      "He said, “Any god other than Allah, shall I seek for you? He it is, above creatures, (this day) Who has favoured you.”",
      "And when from the people of Fir’aun, We delivered you, who with worst of punishments, (cruelly) afflicted you. Your sons, they did kill, and your (daughters/women), they let live. In it was a great trial from your Lord, (and great gift).",

In its place, if it remains firm, then you will see Me.” When his Lord made His Light shine on the Mountain, He crushed it to fine dust; Musa fell down unconscious. When his senses, he recovered; he said, “Glory be to you! Repenting, I turn to you, and I am the first Believer.”",
      "He said, “Musa! I have chosen you by My Message and… My words above all men! Take what I give, and give thanks!”",

      "After Musa left, his people, from their (trinkets/jewelry), made a calf— a lifeless body, mooing. Did they not see it not talking… to them, nor showing the way. They took it; unjust were, they.",
      "And when they regretted and saw that they had gone astray; they said, “If our (true) Lord does not have mercy on us, and he does not pardon us, then we will be of the lost.”",
      "And when Musa came back to his people angry, grieved, he said, “How badly in my place you acted after me. Did you (becoming impatient), hasten on your Lord’s judgment?” Putting down Tablets, his brother he seized by his (head/hair), dragging him towards him. He said, “O’ son of my mother! People considered me weak, and near killing me, they were. Let not foes rejoice at me; count me not with wrongdoers.”",

No mortal is this, but a Noble Angel!”",
      "She said, “This is he about whom you reproach me. I did seek of him his person, but he sought chastity. If he does not do my bidding, (then) imprisoned, he will be; and will be of the disgraced, (brought low), undoubtedly.”",

      "We see you one of the righteous.” He said, “Food, you get for eating… will not come to you but before it I will tell you its meaning. Of knowledge, it is a part; which, me, my Lord has taught. I reject the ways of a people, who do not believe… in Allah, and in Hereafter also, they disbelieve.",

      "Fellows of prison! To his king, one of you will serve wine: other will be crucified; of his head, birds will eat. The matter you inquire about has been so decreed.”",
      "He said to one of the two, he knew would (certainly) be freed: “Remember me (O’ the cup-bearer) in presence of your lord.” Satan made him forget to mention Yusuf to his lord. So in prison he remained, for some more years, detained.",

      "He said, “You will sow as usual, seven continuous years. Leave it what you reap, but a little which you eat, in ears.",
      "Then will come seven hard years after it, which will devour… all, but a little which you save; (for them, what you store).",
      "Then will follow that a year, for men, of abundant water: in it, they will press juices (and oils; pleasure everywhere).",
      "The king said, “Bring him to me.” Came to him, when the messenger; he said, “Go you back to your lord. Ask him, “How fare… the women who cut their hands? My Lord knows their snare.”",
      "(“O’ women!”), the king enquired, “Tell me! What was your affair… when you tried to win over Yusuf?” They said, “Holy, Allah is. We found in him no evil; (innocent, indeed, he is).” Wife of Aziz said, “Now the truth is (evident/ discovered). To (entice/allure) him, I sought; truthful man, indeed, he is.”",
      "Said, “This all I did, that Aziz may know, I did not… betray him in his absence; and that Allah lets not… guile of betrayers succeed; (it is bound to fail indeed). ”",
      "“I (do not acquit/absolve not) myself; evil does bid man’s self, but to whom my Lord is kind; my Lord is Forgiving, Kind.”",
      "And the king ordered (his men), “(Go and) bring Yusuf to me. I will draw him close to me.” When he spoke to him, said he, “This day, you are in our presence, an honoured, trusted man.”",
      "Said, “(Over/On) land’s treasures, (set/put s) me; watchful, knowing, I am.”",
      "Thus We settled Yusuf in that land, to live there as he willed. We touch, (We honour) with Our mercy, whomever We will. We allow not, to be lost, reward of good-doers.",
      "Better for fearing Believers is reward of Hereafter.",
      "And brothers of Yusuf came, and (appeared before/they entered unto) him. He recognized them, but they did not recognize him.",
      "When he got ready their baggage, he said, “Bring to me a brother… of yours from your father. See you not I give full measure,",
      "and I am the best of hosts? If you bring him not to me, no measure for you with me; nor shall you come near me.”",
      "They said, “We shall (try to get/desire) him from his father; we will do it.”",
      "He said to his servants, “Put their money back in their packs, that they recognize it when to their homes, they go back; hoped it is that (to Egypt), they will (surely) come back.”",
      "So when they returned to their father, they said, “O’ our father! The measure is denied us, so send with us our brother.",
      "We will take of him good care.” He said, “Should I trust you… with him but as I entrusted his brother before, to you? Allah is the Best Guard; Most Merciful of all.”",
      "When they opened their goods, found their money returned. They said, “O’ our (dear) father! What further should we desire? (See), this our (entire) money has been, to us, returned! We shall bring provisions for our family, and guard our brother, and shall have an extra camel-load; this is a light measure.”",
      "He said, “I will never send him with you, until you give me… this solemn pledge of Allah that you will bring him back to me; but surrounded, if you be.” When they had given him their… solemn pledge; he said, “Allah is witness over, what say, we.”",
      "And he said, “O’ my sons! “Do not enter by one gate, but go in form different gates. And I, against Allah, (with this my advice), will be of no help to you. To Allah, all command belongs. I, in him alone, put my trust. And the trusting ones should, in Him alone, put their trust.”",
      "And when they entered as their father had advised them; it could not, against Allah, be of any help to them; but wish of Ya’qub’s heart, which he satisfied, it was. And undoubtedly because of whatever, him, We taugt, a man knowledge he was. Most people, yet know not.",
      "When they went in before Yusuf, his brother, with him he lodged; and said, “I am your brother; at what they do, grieve not.”",
      "(Giving them provisions), ready, their baggage, when he got: he put drinking-cup in pack of his brother: then cried a crier, “O’ you people of caravan! Undoubtedly, thieves, you are.”",
      "They said, and they turned towards them, “What is it, you have missed?”",
      "They said, “King’s drinking-cup we miss; he who brings it, he shall have a camel-load; I (pledge my word/am guarantor) for it.”",
      "They said, “By Allah! You know that to make any mischief, in this land (of yours), we have not come; and we are no thieves.”",
      "They said, “What should be penalty for it, if you men be liars?”",
      "They said, “Its penalty! He in whose pack, it is found, will himself be its penalty. Thus we punish wrongdoers.”",
      "He began the search with their bags prior to his brother’s, then took it out of his brother’s. Thus We taught a plan to Yusuf. He had no right to take, under King’s law, his brother, but as Allah wills. We raise in degrees whom We will. Over every (lord/man) of knowledge, One, the All-Knowing is there.",
      "They said, “If he steals, his brother too has stolen before.” Yusuf kept it secret, and to them, he did not disclose. Said, “You are at worse place; well knows Allah, what you state.”",
      "They said, “O’ Aziz! His father is aged, (elderly). Take one of us in his place; you, of generous men, we see.”",
      "He said, “Allah forbid, that we hold anyone but he… with whom our goods are found; then we are unjust indeed.”",
      "So, of him, when they despaired; they went aside to confer. Said the eldest one of them, (when they consulted each other), “From you took pledge in name of Allah, your father; know you not? And how have you done injustice in case of Yusuf in past? So this place I shall not leave, till my father gives me leave, or Allah judges for me; and is Best of judges, He.”",
      "Go you back to your father, and say, “O’ father! Your son… has undoubtedly stolen. We bear witness to only… what we know, and over the unseen, we were not guardians.",
      "Ask the town where we were, and that caravan… in which we have come; and no doubt, the truth, we have spoken.”",
      "He said, “Nay, in fact for you made your soul (an excuse/a thing easy). So patience is best; I anticipate that to me… Allah will bring all of them; Knowing Wise, He is indeed.”",
      "And he turned his face away from them; and said, “Alas for Yusuf!” And his eyes were whitened with grief, he suppressed his sorrow.",
      "They said, “By Allah! You will never cease remembering Yusuf… until you approach grave, or (finally) pass away.”",
      "He said, “I express but to Allah, my distress and sorrow. And I know those (glories of/things from) Allah which you do not know.",
      "O’ my sons! Go and seek news of Yusuf and his brother, and give up not hope of Allah’s mercy; only Disbelievers… are such men, of comforting mercy of Allah, who despair.”",
      "They, when came (back) into his presence, they said, “O’ Aziz! Great misfortune befell us and our family. And we brought a meager sum. So give us full measure please, and to us be charitable. God rewards the charitable.”",
      "Asked, he, “Do you know what you did with Yusuf and his brother…",
      "in your ignorance? (Remember)!” They said, “(Tell), if Yusuf you are!” He said, “I am Yusuf, and this (Binyamin) is my brother. Allah has done us His Favour. He who fears and endures… with patience: Allah does not waste reward of good-doers.”",
      "They said, “By Allah! Above us, Allah has exalted you; and (we confess all our mistakes), we have been sinful.”",
      "He said, “No reproach on you today; may Allah forgive you. And He is the Most Merciful of all the merciful.",
      "Go with this shirt of mine, and lay it on face of my father. He shall come to see; and bring all your (family/folk) to me.”",
      "When caravan left (Egypt), in (Canaan) said their father, “Scent of Yusuf, I find, if a dotard, you do not say me.”",
      "They said, “By Allah! Still you are lost in your (attachment, affection), old.”",
      "When arrived bearer of good news, he threw (Yusuf’s/that) shirt … over face of Yaqub, so his sight was restored. Said, “Did I not tell you, I know (from/of) Allah which you know not?”",
      "They said, “Father! Beg forgiveness of our sins; we are sinful.”",
      "He said, “I shall ask forgiveness for you, of my Lord. He indeed is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
      "When they entered yusuf’s presence; to him, Yousuf took his parents; and said, “(Now) enter Egypt, secure, if Allah pleases.”",
      "On the throne, (then) he seated, (giving them honour), his parents; and they all (fell in Sajdah/prostrated) before him, (paying him homage). He said, “This is, O’ my father, meaning of my vision, (previous/earlier). My Lord made it true. To me, He has been too gracious, when he took me out of prison, and he brought you from desert, after Satan made strife between me and my brothers. (Kind/Tender) is my Lord to whom He wills; He is Knowing Judicious.”",
      "“Lord! You have given me of (kingdom/power), and taught me… interpretation of dreams. O’ You, of heavens and earth… (Creator/Maker)! You are my helper in this world and Hereafter. Make me die as Muslim, and join me with the righteous.”",
      "This is of the news of the Unseen, to you, We reveal. You were not with them when on their course of action, they agreed; and their plots, they conceived, (worked on their intrigues).",

      "Say (O’ Beloved), “This is my way, I call towards Allah. I have insight; and those too who are my followers. Glory be to Allah, and I am not of the Idolaters.”",
      "Before you, We sent not, but only men as Messengers. To them We revealed Message. Of dwellers of towns, they were. Have they not travelled in land and seen what has been the end… of the people before them? The abode of Hereafter… is better for them who fear. Bother you not to consider?",
      "Till when Prophets despaired of men, and thought men that they were… made false promise, Our help reached (Our Messengers). Then, We saved those whom We had willed, (of Our wrath). And never is averted from sinful people, (Our wrath).",

      "He has but forbidden carrion, blood and swine flesh for you, and which was slaughtered while, other than Allah’s name, invoking. But he who is forced, neither craving nor (in it exceeding/to it reverting); then indeed Allah is Forgiving (and) Merciful (for you).",

      "Listen, men! A case is related; (mind, to it apply). They you worship besides Allah cannot create a fly: though for it they get together. If, should rob them, the fly, of something, from it they cannot (retrieve/release) it. How feeble are… (both), the seeker and the sought; (the worshippers and their gods)!",

The one of his party asked him for help against him… who was of his foes; with his fist, Musa (punched/thumped) him; but this blow finished him off. He said, “This is work of Satan. He is surely an enemy and a misleader open.”",

      "(Look!) Qaroon was of Musa’s folk; he oppressed them. And We gave him such treasures, that a group of mighty men, their keys would weigh down. Said to him, his folk, when, “Do not exult; Allah likes not the exulting men.",

      "He said, “Only through my own knowledge, this, I have been given.” Did he not know that Allah destroyed before him generations… stronger than him in power and greater in accumulation? And the (known) sinners, about their sins, are not questioned.",
      "Once, before his people, he came out in all his finery. Those desiring the life of this world said, “If only… we too had the like of that, what has been given, Qaroon. (Lucky) verily he is, a lord of great good fortune.”",

Enter not houses of the Prophet unless… permitted for meal, and wait not for its preparation: but enter when invited, and disperse after you have eaten, without engaging yourselves in (amusing/familiar) talks. This would discomfort the Prophet, but he had regard for you. And Allah is not ashamed of telling you what is true. When you ask of his wives something, ask from behind… a curtain; for your hearts and their hearts, that is purer. It is not for you to give trouble to Allah’s Messenger, or to marry his wives ever after him; this would be… a very severe thing in the sight of Allah indeed.",

You are of the people of the Hell.” (To them, O’ Prophet, say).",
